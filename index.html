        <a class="header" href="https://materovcompetition.org/" target="_blank"> Underwater Robotics </a>
        <p>
            The MATE ROV Competition is an underwater robotics (aka remotely operated vehicle or ROV) challenge that engages a global community of learners and focuses on developing new, innovative solutions to real-world problems in the marine environment. Teams can be as small as 3 students, or much larger with over 20 students.
            <br> <br>
            For the competition, teams develop robots that can be piloted remotely to swim underwater and perform various tasks such as picking up objects and moving things around. This past year, I was the Electronics/Programming Lead in the 8-person team I am on.

        <a class="header" href="https://science.osti.gov/wdts/nsb" target="_blank"> Science Bowl </a>
        <p>
            The Science Bowl competition is an academic competition testing knowledge of various areas within science and mathematics. It covers topics such as physics, chemistry, math, biology, and earth and space. Teams can consist of four main competitors, as well as coaches, mentors, and alternates.
            <br> <br>
            I am on my high school's team, and I participated for two years in middle school as well. On my high school's team, my focus is mainly physics and earth science, but I  contribute with chemistry and mathematics questions as well.
        </p>
        <br> <br>
        <a class="header" href="https://www.pbs.org/show/east-tennessee-pbs-scholars-bowl/" target="_blank"> PBS Scholars' Bowl </a>
        <p>
            Similar to science bowl, Scholars' Bowl is a competition where teams of four students (plus alternates) answer trivia questions about various topics, including art, foreign languages, grammar, history, biology, chemistry, math, mythology, geography and literature.
            <br> <br>
            On my high school's Scholars' Bowl Team, my focus is mainly math, geography, mythology, and german, but I contribute with chemistry questions as well.

        <a class="header"z href="https://www.toastmasters.org/" target="_blank"> Gavel Club of Toastmaster's International </a>
        <p>
            Gavel Club is a program that helps students develop crucial communication and public speaking skills, as well as the necessary writing and listening skills needed to achieve that. The focus of the program is ten speeches that each focus on improving a different skill, with members receiving an award once they have presented all ten.
            <br> <br>
            Within my local Gavel Club, I will be serving as the Vice President of Education for a second year, and going on to be in the club for my fourth year. So far I've given eight of the ten speeches, and particularly enjoy giving satirical or comedic speeches.

        <a class="header"z href="https://hackclub.com" target="_blank"> Hack Club </a>
        <p>
            Hack Club is a nonprofit focused on helping teenagers around the globe learn and make software and hardware. It runs a wide variety of jams, workshops, You-Ship-We-Ship programs, virtual events, and in-person Hackathons to inspire projects, help students learn how to make them, and provide a fun, collaborative environment for them to build those projects.
            <br> <br>
            At Hack Club, I lead the Special Activities Division, which manages and runs virtual events like workshops, game jams, online escape rooms, game nights, and so much more, as well as helping community members get involved and run their own events! I also am part of the Welcoming Team and help welcome new members to the Hack Club Slack. Through Hack Club, I have made several projects for different You-Ship-We-Ships and events, including Boba, Seasonal Boba Events, Arcade, High Seas, and the Days of Service Ascend Hackathon.

        <h3> Personal Website </h3>
        <p>
            A personal website for me, and the website you're currently on! This was my first ever website and my first foray into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which is why it's fairly simple.

        <h3> Banana Duck Conservation Website </h3>
        <p>
            In recent years, climate change and deforestation has led to the endagerment and extinction of many species. Many of these species are found in tropical rainforests beyond our thought. However, one species, the Banana Duck, is disappearing before our very eyes. With the Official Banana Duck Conservation Website, learn what you can do to help conserve banana ducks! Read articles, watch a nature documentary, explore merchandise, and even chat with a real-life banana duck in real-time!

        <h3> Banana Duck Alien Assimilator </h3>
        <p>
            I created this project with two others for Hack Club's Days of Service Ascend Summit in LA! Our prompt was what technical tool would you want to bring with you into space? We choose to make a VR headset for astronauts to practice speaking with a special species of aliens called Banana Ducks! I mainly worked on the website side of the project, including the A-Frame and JavaScript.

        <h3> Trivia Study Site </h3>
        <p>
            A review and studying website for trivia topics, with various multiple choice and free answer settings. I initially created it for studying topics and old questions for Scholar's Bowl competitions, but expanded it to include any other small topics I needed to study and memorize, like physics formulas for Science Bowl.
